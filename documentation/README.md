## Overview

In this House Sale Price Prediction ( HSPP ) project, we would like to implement various state of the art (SOTA) data science techniques to solve a given [business problem](business-problem.md). The business problem of HSPP is very clearly explained in [Business Problem](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] page.

As mentioned in the [Business Problem](broken-reference)[ ](business-problem.md), we have to predict the sale price ( numeric variable ) of a given house with given set of features. This is a regression problem. We will apply the following techniques to give statistical solution to boost the business performance.&#x20;

*   Data&#x20;

    * Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Feature Extraction (or) Featuring Engineering


*   Machine Learning Model&#x20;

    * Linear Regression Model Development
    * Gradient Boosting Regression Model Development


*   Testing

    * Unit Testing of each component
    * Integration Test of every component in pipeline
    * Differential Testing of two developed models


* Deployment
  * Shadow mode deployment
